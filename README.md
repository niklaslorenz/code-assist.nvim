- [ ] Conversation "Snippets" (see [./conversations-roadmap.md](./conversations-roadmap.md)):

  - Indexed by topics
  - Searchable via vector_stores
  - Link to each other
  - Whenever a new snippet is created, the context is automatically updated with content
    from snippets with similar topics

## BUGS

- When renaming a convesation, last_conversation is not updated resulting in a new conversation being created when opened again after restart

## Setup

Lazy:

```lua

{
  "niklaslorenz/code-assist.nvim",
  config = function()
    -- nothing needed here, pluginâ€™s init.lua wires it up
  end,
  keys = {
    { "<leader>as", "<cmd>AIChatSelect<CR>", desc = "AI Chat: select conversation" },
    { "<leader>an", "<cmd>AIChatNew<CR>",    desc = "AI Chat: new conversation" },
  },
}
```
